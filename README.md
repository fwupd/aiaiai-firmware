# aiaiai-firmware

AIAIAI is an audio design company dedicated to developing high quality
headphones & earphones. This includes the TMA-2, the world's first modular
headphone system.

This repository contains firmware for various AIAIAI devices. The built .cab
files are designed to be uploaded to the Linux Vendor Firmware Service.

Users wishing to upload the firmware on their TMA-2 need to connect the USB
cable then press and hold the top and bottom buttons for 10 seconds until the
LED turns off. When using fwupd >= 1.0.3 the firmware can be updated using
`fwupdmgr update` or using GNOME Software.
